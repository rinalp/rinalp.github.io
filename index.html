			<h2>About</h2>
			<section>
				<p>Now then, let's play. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. This is truly an almighty mountain. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>
				<p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Anything you want to do you can do here. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.</p>
				<p>We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Happy painting, God bless. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
